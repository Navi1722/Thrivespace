# Streamlit Q-Learning App

## Overview
This project is a *mental wellness application* built using *Streamlit, integrating **Q-learning* to enhance user experiences based on sentiment analysis. The app dynamically generates recommendations based on users' emotional states.

## Features
- *User Input Form*: Collects emotional state data.
- *Sentiment Analysis*: Uses TextBlob to analyze the user's input.
- *Q-Learning Algorithm*: Determines the best action (recommendation) to improve the user's sentiment score.
- *Dynamic Content Display*: Adjusts UI elements based on sentiment.
- *Streamlit UI*: Interactive and user-friendly interface for easy accessibility.

## Technologies Used
- *Python*
- *Streamlit* (for UI)
- *TextBlob* (for sentiment analysis)
- *Q-learning* (for reinforcement learning implementation)
